# Why?
## Version: 1.0

* Wanted to create a hashing algorithm like bcrypt (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt). Except, I wanted it to take longer to hash the original message so dictionary attacks will be practically useless againts the hashes.
* Since this hashing algorithm is most likely not going to be very popular, it will be a good choice to use since most hash cracking software won't support it.
* To keep Databases more secure.
# Contribution

Your contribution will only be accepted if it goes by the following criteria:
